# reading-note

This repo is used to record some interesting thoughts and ideas during my coding life.

## A bunch of interesting Python project
1. cherrypy: extreme concise, easy to learn. The leaning curve is like Flask. While, it is more object oriented. I love it!
2. flask: simple web framework. Use jinja2 as the template engine, which I like most.
3. luigi: a DAG job scheduler built by Spotify. Much powerful than Azkaban, ane much straigtforward to oozie. Oozie really sucks. too compliated. While, Azkaban is not very friendly to developer. The properties file is really hard to debug and edit. Luigi let me write python code to execute batch job. And easy to integarte with S3 or other AWS stuff with Boto.
4. Boto: aws python sdk
5. splunk-sdk: a restful wrapper for splunk. I like the design and architecture of this package. Very nice abstraction!

## Front end libs
I am not a frontend expect. Jut put them in this page, in case I forgot them. ⊙﹏⊙b
1. backbone js
2. jquery
